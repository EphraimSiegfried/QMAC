PDSR: Packet delivery success ratio
PRR: Paket reduction ratio
IOMC: implicit overhearing node-based multi-hop communication
OH: overhearing nodes

PDSR and PRR improved through IOMC 
Implicit relay nodes or opportunistic relay nodes perform overhearing to promote relaying.
GW gets the packetfrom the best OH closer to it.
Best OH has low SF, lower BER and higher residual energy and is evaluated through link reliability using BER and residual energy. 
All nodes participate in the process of determining the best OH. 

We see higher probability of successful transmission while reducing the number of transmitted packets more
when compared with the two comparison schemes.
